# Delimeter used for separating share/mount details below.
DELIMITER="|"

# The shares that are mounted and monitored.  The variables are separated
# by the delimiter defined above.  Each share/mountpoint entry has four
# or five parameters (the fifth one is optional), in the order specified:
#
# - ro = mount as read only, rw = attempt to mount as read/write (share permissions may override this setting)
#
# - remote host name or IP
#
# - remote share path
#
# - local mount point (must exist)
#
# - Name of the remote test file (optional; usually a static, unmutable file that is used to detect whether
#   the remote content is accessible).  Even when the remote NFS server and the share are available, remote
#   server conditions, such as a failed mount (e.g. /home/somedir --X--> /nfs4exports/somedir) may put the data
#   out of reach. No action is taken when the defined remote test file is unavailable, but a warning is issued.
#   You can also use this feature to add functionality as needed. "." is used as placeholder.
#
# - Name of the local test file (optional; if the file exists, the share will be unmount)
#
# You can also use NFS to re-mount a local directory as read-only.
